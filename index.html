          Hello, my name is Jon Tousley. I was born in Rochester, New York in
          1990. Shortly thereafter my family moved to Northern Virginia, where I
          was raised. Growing up, my passion was always soccer (I always dreamt
          of being a professional when I grew up), however, when I reached
          high-school, I gradually shifted over to focusing on playing guitar
          and music in general. After grade-school I attended James Madison
          University where I went on to graduate from in 2015 with a Bachelor of
          Arts degree. After college, I moved to Colorado and have been with a
          roofing company ever since. My job there is to collaborate with
          insurance companies to make sure the insurance provider returns the
          insured to pre-loss condition and pays a fair price. However, recently
          I have found a new love for computer science and programming and hope
          to make that my new career. Most of my free time is spent exercising,
          playing guitar, reading historical non-fiction, and watching soccer.
          My dream going forward is to have the kind of lifestyle that allows me
          to travel and see as much of the world as possible.
        </p>
